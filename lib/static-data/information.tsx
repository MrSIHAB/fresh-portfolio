      <strong>👋 Hello survivors, I'm SIHAB —</strong>{" "}
      A self-taught developer who loves building useful tools, systems, and
      cross-platform apps. I work with Deno and TypeScript on the backend, and
      Flutter to create apps for Android and Linux. I enjoy solving real
      problems—like making a custom VPN app or a simple database tool like
      EasyKV. <br />
      My goal is to keep things{" "}
      fast, clean, and easy to use—for both developers and users.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">✔ My Journey?</h4>
    <p>
      Ever since childhood, I’ve been fascinated by technology. I was a top
      student in mathematics, and that logical mindset made programming feel
      natural. Over the past{" "}
      <mark>4 years+</mark>, I've turned that passion into a career—exploring,
      learning, and building real-world applications.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">✔ What I Do</h4>
    <p>
      In simple words,{" "}
      <mark>Web, Android, Desktop & Backend</mark>&nbsp; development. App
      includes Android, Windows and Linux apps. I can't compile the iOS
      applications because I don't have a Mac yet. But I can give the codes.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">
      ✔ Web Applications
    </h4>
    <p>
      For simple, lightweight websites, I stick to{" "}
      <mark>
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
      </mark>—they’re fast and resource-friendly. And sometimes I just take
      Fresh framework and that work near to the raw performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more complex web apps, I use{" "}
      <mark>Nextjs & Fresh.js</mark>. They both are great frameworks for making
      fullstack applications. While Nextjs handles the complexity of React
      Server component, Fresh uses Preact with Island architecture. Both are SEO
      friendly.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">
      ✔ Backend Development
    </h4>
    <p>
      I prefer <mark>Node & Deno</mark>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<mark>
        Express & Hono
      </mark>&nbsp;framework. Since I have prepared myself mostly with
      TypeScript and JavaScript I feel more comfortable with them. While Node is
      dominating the market, Deno came to replace the complexity of existing
      Node echo-system.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">
      ✔ Mobile App Development
    </h4>
    <p>
      I use <mark>Flutter</mark>{" "}
      to build cross-platform and mobile apps. Flutter gives me fast performance
      and built-in Material Design.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">
      ✔ Desktop App Development
    </h4>
    <p>
      Using{" "}
      <mark>Electron</mark>, I build cross-platform desktop apps with web tech
      (React, TypeScript, Node.js).
    </p>
    <p>
      But when performance matters, I prefer{" "}
      <mark>Flutter</mark>—it’s fast, beautiful, and lightweight thanks to its
      custom rendering engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each framework has its strengths, and I choose based on the project's
      goals—not hype.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">
      ✔ Linux Is My Daily Driver
    </h4>
    <p>
      I’ve been using <mark>Ubuntu Linux</mark>{" "}
      as my primary OS for 10+ months now. It gives me deep control, great
      performance, and is my go-to for server deployment and development.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">
      ✔ My Approach to Performance
    </h4>
    <p>
      Performance matters. Whether it’s web, mobile, or desktop—I always
      optimize based on the platform and client needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flutter helps a lot, but for other tech, I personally make sure everything
      runs smoothly and efficiently.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">
      ✔ A Bit More About Me
    </h4>
    <p>
      You’ve heard what I do—now a little about <mark>who I am</mark>:
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a self-driven learner who loves solving problems and bringing ideas to
      life. I believe in simplicity, clean code, and always improving my craft.
      Still trying to learn something new, build something useful. And explore
      potential technology. As of now, I have created some off topic things.
      Such as{" "}
      <mark>
        Material Homepage Browser Extension, EasyKv database ORM, Split Button
        Flutter package, VS-code Theme Mathab, and so on...

      Hello, survivor 👋 What are you looking for today? What do you want to
      know?
      <br />
      <br />

      Are you curious about how I learned programming from YouTube,
      documentation, forums, and—yes—ChatGPT? Mostly by building things just for
      fun, breaking them, and building again.
      <br />
      <br />

      Or maybe you want to know which of those “fun projects” actually went
      live? How to install Material Homepage in your favorite browser? Or
      perhaps you came here for VS Code mathab? Although you might also be
      looking for EasyKV, Vanilla-UI, or Split Button.
      <br />
      <br />

      What—never heard of them? Maybe you’re just trying to figure out what I
      do. To be honest, I’m still figuring that out myself.
      <br />
      Sometimes I enjoy building backends with Node.js. Other times, I switch to
      Deno for a cleaner experience. I tried React to follow the trend, Flutter
      to build mobile apps, and Flutter again—this time for crazy desktop
      terminal. When Rust started replacing C++ in our hearts, Go grabbed my
      attention. “How can something feel so much like TypeScript in terms of
      types declaration, yet not be TypeScript?”
      <br />
      I’ve built VS Code themes. That doesn't means I can't build browser
      extensions like Material Homepage, and while Tailwind CSS powers this
      portfolio, I still write raw CSS when the case demands it.
      <br />
      If you’re wondering where Python is—well, when it was time to learn
      Python, I chose Go instead. Because I’m a Ronaldo fan. And I believe in
      hard work. Show some respect to this best player in the world's fan.
      <br />
      So, it turns out who am I? A frontend developer? Backend developer? Mobile
      or desktop developer? Full-stack? Plugin developer? Programmer? Software
      engineer? Or just a coder? In my opinion…
      <span class="text-nowrap font-semibold">I am Shoaib Hossain</span>. You
      can call me <mark>SIHAB</mark>.
      <br />
      <br />

      If you want to know why and how I got into programming—sorry, that’s
      private. I won’t talk about HTML, C++, or how long it grabbed my attention
      in XI-XII. It violates my privacy about "How to center a{" "}
      <span style={{ color: "#df00df" }}>{"<"}div{">"}</span>. The div will
      never forgive me. It exposes the fact that I likes to explore new things.
      That is a top secret in this AI revolutionary time. So I can't tell you
      that.
      <br />
      <br />

      If you came here looking for a contact button and you’re still searching
      for Email or Social Media buttons, may{" "}
      <mark class="font-bold">Allah</mark> bless your eyes.
      <br />
      <br />

      No matter what you’re searching for, my final response is simple:
      <mark>
        <del>I use Arch BTW</del>. I use Ubuntu BTW.
      </mark>
    </p>
