      ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Shoaib â€” Your Programming Buddy
    </h3>
    <p>
      A self-taught developer who loves building useful tools, systems, and
      cross-platform apps. I work with Deno and TypeScript on the backend, and
      Flutter to create apps for Android and Linux. I enjoy solving real
      problemsâ€”like making a{" "}
      <mark>
        custom VPN app or a simple database tool like EasyKV
      </mark>. My goal is to keep things fast, clean, and easy to useâ€”for both
      developers and users.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h4 class="text-xl text-primary font-semibold">âœ” My Journey?</h4>
    <p>
      Ever since childhood, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by technology. I was a top
      student in mathematics, and that logical mindset made programming feel
      natural. Over the past 3 years, I've turned that passion into a
      careerâ€”exploring, learning, and building real-world applications.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h4 class="text-xl text-primary font-semibold">âœ” What I Do</h4>
    <p>
      In simple words,{" "}
      <mark>App development, Web and Backend development</mark>. App includes
      Android, Windows and Linux apps. I can't compile the iOS applications
      because I don't have a Mac yet. But I can give the codes.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h4 class="text-xl text-primary font-semibold">
      âœ” Web Applications
    </h4>
    <p>
      For simple, lightweight websites, I stick to{" "}
      <mark>
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
      </mark>â€”theyâ€™re fast and resource-friendly. And sometimes I just take
      Fresh framework and that work near to the raw performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more complex web apps, I use{" "}
      <mark>Nextjs and Fresh.js</mark>. They both are great frameworks for
      making fullstack applications. While Nextjs handles the complexity of
      React Server component, Fresh uses Preact with Island architecture. Both
      are SEO friendly.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h4 class="text-xl text-primary font-semibold">
      âœ” Backend Development
    </h4>
    <p>
      I prefer{" "}
      <mark>Node or Deno with Express or Hono framework</mark>. Since I have
      prepared myself mostly with TypeScript and JavaScript I feel more
      comfortable with them. While Node is dominating the market, Deno came to
      replace the complexity of existing Node echo-system.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h4 class="text-xl text-primary font-semibold">
      âœ” Mobile App Development
    </h4>
    <p>
      I use <mark>Flutter</mark>{" "}
      to build cross-platform and mobile apps. Flutter gives me fast performance
      and built-in Material Design.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h4 class="text-xl text-primary font-semibold">
      âœ” Desktop App Development
    </h4>
    <p>
      Using{" "}
      <mark>Electron</mark>, I build cross-platform desktop apps with web tech
      (React, TypeScript, Node.js).
    </p>
    <p>
      But when performance matters, I prefer{" "}
      <mark>Flutter</mark>â€”itâ€™s fast, beautiful, and lightweight thanks to its
      custom rendering engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each framework has its strengths, and I choose based on the project's
      goalsâ€”not hype.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h4 class="text-xl text-primary font-semibold">
      âœ” Linux Is My Daily Driver
    </h4>
    <p>
      Iâ€™ve been using <mark>Ubuntu Linux</mark>{" "}
      as my primary OS for 10+ months now. It gives me deep control, great
      performance, and is my go-to for server deployment and development.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h4 class="text-xl text-primary font-semibold">
      âœ” My Approach to Performance
    </h4>
    <p>
      Performance matters. Whether itâ€™s web, mobile, or desktopâ€”I always
      optimize based on the platform and client needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flutter helps a lot, but for other tech, I personally make sure everything
      runs smoothly and efficiently.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-xl text-primary font-semibold">
      âœ” A Bit More About Me
    </h4>
    <p>
      Youâ€™ve heard what I doâ€”now a little about <mark>who I am</mark>:
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a self-driven learner who loves solving problems and bringing ideas to
      life. I believe in simplicity, clean code, and always improving my craft.
      Still trying to learn something new, build something useful. And explore
      potential technology. As of now, I have created some off topic things.
      Such as{" "}
      <mark>
        Material Homepage Browser Extension, EasyKv database ORM, Split Button
        Flutter package, VS-code Theme Mathab, and so on...
      </mark>
